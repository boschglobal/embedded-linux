Normally these cookies are no longer valid after 30 days. If you   visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and   the relevant conversion partner can recognize that a certain user clicked on   the advertisement and thereby was redirected to our website. This can also be   done across multiple devices. The information obtained by means of the   conversion cookie serves the purpose of compiling conversion statistics and   recording the total number of users who clicked on the respective   advertisement and were redirected to a website with a conversion tracking tag.</li> </ul> <p>Please note that using the tools might include transfer of your data to recipients outside of the EEA where there is no adequate level of data protection pursuant to the GDPR (e.g. the USA).

Plugins</p> <p>Our online offers include the use of plugins provided by various social and other networks.</p> <p>These plugins are additional features made available by the network providers.</p> <p>As a default setting, these plugins are inactive.</p> <p>To enhance the protection of your data when visiting our website, we use a \u201c2-click solution\u201d to integrate the plugins into the page. This 2-click solution keeps your visit to our websites from being recorded and possibly evaluated by the providers of the respective plugins by default.</p> <p>If you do not wish the providers of the respective networks to receive data about your use of this online offer and possibly to store or further use this data, you should not activate the respective plugins.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Activating plugins   You yourself can decide whether you want to interact with the respective   provider\u2019s network and whether your data is to be transmitted to the   respective provider or not. Only if you click on the button provided (\u201cAgree\u201d)   will the respective plugin be activated and integrated into the page, and the   content of the respective plugin be transmitted from the server of the   associated provider directly to your browser. A second click will then allow   you to perform the desired interaction with the network. If you decide to   activate a plugin, you give us permission to process your data based on your   consent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collection of data by providers   When a plugin is activated, your internet browser establishes a direct   connection to the respective provider\u2019s servers. Even if you do not have a   user account with the provider or are not currently logged in to such an   account, this connection notifies the respective provider that your internet   browser has called up the corresponding page of our online offer.   If you already have a user account with a provider of a network and are   already logged in when you visit our websites, the operator of the respective   network may be able to assign the visit to your personal user account as soon   as you activate plugins. This may enable the provider to analyze your usage   behavior and store it in a profile.   In addition, your IP address and other data about your browser settings will   be transmitted by your internet browser directly to a server of the respective   provider and may be stored there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Further processing of data by providers   Plugins are additional features made available by network providers. We   therefore have no influence on the further processing of the data that the   respective network providers\u2019 plugins collect and store.   To find out more about the purpose and scope of each provider\u2019s activities to   collect, further process, and delete data, as well as about your respective   rights and data protection options, please consult the respective provider\u2019s   privacy policy.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Deactivate the plugin   If you activate a plugin, the activation applies to the specific plugin only,   and only for as long as you visit the page into which the plugin is   integrated.   If you no longer wish to use an activated plugin, it can be deactivated by   reloading the website. Please note that this does not affect data that has   already been transmitted.\u202f </p> </li> </ul> <p>We use plugins from the providers listed below:</p> <p>5.1 \u00b7 YouTube</p> <p>This online offer uses the YouTube video platform, which is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (\u201cYouTube\u201d). YouTube is a platform that enables the playback of audio and video files.</p> <p>In order to enhance your data protection when visiting our website, the YouTube content is integrated into the page in \u201cenhanced privacy mode.\u201d</p> <p>This means that the video will only be loaded and a connection to YouTube, including a transmission of log data to YouTube, only established once the corresponding plugin has been activated. If the plugin is activated, data will also be transmitted to YouTube and the Google DoubleClick advertising network contacted. This may trigger further data processing operations over which we have no control. If the YouTube video is loaded, cookies are also used.</p> <p>To find out more about the scope and purpose of YouTube\u2019s activities to collect, further process, and use data, about possible transfers of personal data to third countries such as the United States, about your rights and the data protection options available to you, please consult YouTube\u2019s privacy policy.</p> <p>5.2 \u00b7 Google Maps</p> <p>This online offer uses Google Maps map services. Google Maps is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (\u201cGoogle\u201d).</p> <p>Loading the map requires that you activate the corresponding plugin. If you activate the plugin, data will be transmitted to Google and the Google DoubleClick advertising network contacted. This may trigger further data processing operations over which we have no control. If the map is loaded, cookies are also used.</p> <p>To find out more about the scope and purpose of Google Maps\u2019 activities to collect, further process, and use data, about possible transfers of personal data to third countries such as the United States, about your rights and the data protection options available to you, please consult Google\u2019s privacy policy.</p> <p>6. Content Delivery Network of Microsoft Azure</p> <p>In order to optimize the loading times of our online offer, we use Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) Services. Providers are Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA and Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18 D18, Ireland.</p> <p>The CDN helps to provide the content of our online offer \u2014 especially large media files such as graphics, text, or scripts \u2014 more quickly with the help of a network of geographically distributed servers, thereby reducing loading times.</p> <p>The use of the CDN services is based on our overriding legitimate interest within the meaning of article 6 section 1 lit. f GDPR in the efficient provision of our online offer.</p> <p>In context of this processing, personal data is transmitted to the USA. The transmission is based on European Standard Contractual Clauses in which Microsoft guarantees to comply with the European data protection law for its provided services.</p> <p>Further information on privacy in connection with Microsoft\u2019s CDN service is available here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/.

Upon clicking on the link, we have no influence on the collecting, processing, and use of personal data possibly transmitted by clicking on the link to the third party (such as the IP address or the URL of the site on which the link is located) as the conduct of third parties is naturally beyond our control. We do not assume responsibility for the processing of personal data by third parties.</p> <p>8. Security</p> <p>Our employees and the companies providing services on our behalf, are obliged to confidentiality and to compliance with the applicable data protection laws. We take all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security and to protect your data that are administrated by us especially from the risks of unintended or unlawful destruction, manipulation, loss, change, or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access.

Nearly all FOSS licenses require license text and copyright notices to be delivered with the software.

Thus, it seems obvious to organize these tasks \u2013 just like the development of the software itself \u2013 in a community. This realization has led to the idea of a publicly available curation database for FOSS compliance information, so that such materials can be shared for reuse and unnecessary parallel work is avoided.

Instead, the software must be assembled from source code repositories, or existing distributions must be adapted. In both cases, however, features may be missing, which then have to be provided individually. To make this more efficient, providing missing features should be managed collectively, but before doing so it must be known which features are most needed.
