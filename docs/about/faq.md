## Auditorium equipment (keynotes and market place)

For a market place (approximately 8 m²) additionally we organize the following
basics: office table (160x80 cm) or high table, electricity (230V, 6A), 2 chairs.
On top of that, we provide a meta board, which can carry printouts on both sides. An 
example of such a board can be found [here](https://eventura.net/mietwelt-shop/moebel-zubehoer/konferenz-bueromoebel/2136/metaplan-pinnwand-franken-grau-tafelmasse-h150cm-x-b-120cm). The provided meta board will have comparable dimensions and material.

Any additional equipment requests are to be addressed separately to the [conference organization team](../contact.md).
It is possible to send material in parcels of normal size to a postal address of 
the location. The post office of the location is in a different building, hence we 
need to take care about fetching your parcels from there. Please get in contact with
the [conference organization team](../contact.md) to what extend you want to ship upfront.

Your booth presentation will be close to some others and shall not interfere (e. g. noise). 



## Dress code

There is no set dress code and, like many open source events, attendees will
dress in a range, from jeans to suits. Our recommendation is business casual.
