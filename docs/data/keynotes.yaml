  topic: Living Open Source at Siemens

    Building products and services upon open source software (OSS) has become standard, also
    in the domains of Siemens. However, driving or creating OSS according to our needs
    remains challenging.<br/>  
    In this talk, we will try to shed a light on how Siemens embraces OSS, where we believe
    having been successful already, and where we want to improve further. We will look at
    some of our community engagements, may they be directly or via foundations. We will
    furthermore underline the increasing importance of working with our customers and
    suppliers also via OSS communities - openly, constructively, and on eye level. Last but
    not least, we will point out what key role "upstream first" plays in this while not
    denying that this is continuous hard work for everyone who is in touch with both OSS and
    business needs.

  topic: "Community Collaboration Patterns: Addressing Risk and Complexity"
  presenter: Jan Lübbe (CTO) 
  affiliation: Pengutronix
  time: "11:15"
  room: Auditorium
  abstract: |
    In this keynote, we explore the benefits of leveraging open-source collaboration
    patterns to address complexity and reduce risk in embedded Linux product development
    across independent teams. We discuss the concept of long-term maintenance, emphasizing
    the importance of continuous maintenance, upstreaming, and automated processes in
    ensuring secure and fully functional long-life devices.<br/>  
    Focusing on collaborative approaches to risk reduction, we highlight open-source
    collaboration models found in OpenEmbedded/Yocto and the Linux kernel and their
    potential adoption within a multinational company. We emphasize the benefits of shared
    code, standardized build architectures, and reusable tooling and workflows. This keynote
    aims to inspire attendees to explore and implement collaborative  approaches inspired by
    open-source communities within their own teams.
