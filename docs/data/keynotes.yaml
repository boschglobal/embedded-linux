  topic: The maturing OSS community draws European regulators' attention
  presenter: Mirko Boehm
  affiliation: Linux Foundation Europe
  time: "10:30"
  room: Auditorium K
  abstract: |
    As open source software becomes the foundation to build digital products, to run the backbones
    of ICT infrastructure and to ensure digital sovereignty and cyber resilience, both the technology
    as well as the communities that develop it inevitably move into the focus of regulators. The
    European Union is advancing a number of policy initiatives that regulate liability, cyber security,
    data handling and AI applications in digital products, among others. This is a challenge for the
    still quite decentralized and globally operating open source community. How will the open
    source community participate in the legislative processes, and what may be the potential
    impacts of the upcoming regulation on the open source development process and community
    dynamics?

  topic: "Community Collaboration Patterns: Addressing Risk and Complexity"
  presenter: Jan Lübbe 
  affiliation: Pengutronix
  time: "10:45"
  room: Auditorium K
  abstract: |
    In this keynote, we explore the benefits of leveraging open-source collaboration
    patterns to address complexity and reduce risk in embedded Linux product development
    across independent teams. We discuss the concept of long-term maintenance, emphasizing
    the importance of continuous maintenance, upstreaming, and automated processes in
    ensuring secure and fully functional long-life devices.  
    Focusing on collaborative approaches to risk reduction, we highlight open-source
    collaboration models found in OpenEmbedded/Yocto and the Linux kernel and their
    potential adoption within a multinational company. We emphasize the benefits of shared
    code, standardized build architectures, and reusable tooling and workflows. This keynote
    aims to inspire attendees to explore and implement collaborative  approaches inspired by
    open-source communities within their own teams.

  topic: Living Open Source at Siemens
  presenter: Jan Kiszka
  affiliation: Siemens
  time: "11:00"
  room: Auditorium K
  abstract: |
    Building products and services upon open source software (OSS) has become standard, also
    in the domains of Siemens. However, driving or creating OSS according to our needs
    remains challenging.  
    In this talk, we will try to shed a light on how Siemens embraces OSS, where we believe
    having been successful already, and where we want to improve further. We will look at
    some of our community engagements, may they be directly or via foundations. We will
    furthermore underline the increasing importance of working with our customers and
    suppliers also via OSS communities - openly, constructively, and on eye level. Last but
    not least, we will point out what key role "upstream first" plays in this while not
    denying that this is continuous hard work for everyone who is in touch with both OSS and
    business needs.

  room: Auditorium K
  abstract: |
    Invented for life is the motto of us, we are masters in delivering innovations. 
    Thereby is to be observed that variant diversity and complexity of our products are 
    permanently increasing. And nowadays most of our products are connected, which means, 
    they shall kept up-to-date with patches and new functions. Obviously Software plays an 
    increasingly important role in our business. Hence questions about maintainability 
    and scaling of SW capabilities are coming up. In this presentation, we will explain 
    some challenges and elaborate opportunities of open source based collaboration.
