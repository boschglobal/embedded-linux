    Building products and services upon open source software (OSS) has become standard, also
    in the domains of Siemens. However, driving or creating OSS according to our needs
    remains challenging.<br/>  
    In this talk, we will try to shed a light on how Siemens embraces OSS, where we believe
    having been successful already, and where we want to improve further. We will look at
    some of our community engagements, may they be directly or via foundations. We will
    furthermore underline the increasing importance of working with our customers and
    suppliers also via OSS communities - openly, constructively, and on eye level. Last but
    not least, we will point out what key role "upstream first" plays in this while not
    denying that this is continuous hard work for everyone who is in touch with both OSS and
    business needs.
