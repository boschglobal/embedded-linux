  abstract: |
    The FOSS Disclosure Portal of Mercedes-Benz is a custom-built solution to automate and
    digitize the process for disclosure of the Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
    components, which are included in products and applications.<br/>  
    With the FOSS Disclosure Portal we aim at a more efficient, transparent and digital
    software supply chain regarding open source: With the FOSS Disclosure Portal we enable
    our internal and external software suppliers to deliver us information on used open
    source via a technical interface (API) in an ISO standardized exchange format as
    Software Bill of Material (SBOM/SPDX).<br/>  
    Based on these SBOM deliveries, the system supports the responsible project owners
    through automated compliance checks and quality checks on a central inventory. This way
    we enable checking license conformance much easier and faster, identified issues are
    directly resolved with the collaboration of the software supplier.<br/>  
    In this talk, we discuss the role and benefits of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for
    Free & Open Source Software from a license compliance perspective of an automotive OEM.
    After an introduction of basic concepts of SBOM, we sketch the FOSS SBOM consumption
    process and its relation to software composition analysis. The talk concludes with some
    of the identified FOSS SBOM challenges.

  room: Sizi 2
  abstract: |
    The machine economy is on our doorstep. Embedded technologies play a critical part in
    building it.<br/>  
    While the industrial revolution improved our lives, it was not built on sustainable
    energy sources and infrastructure. We cannot afford to build the machine economy in the
    same way. A sustainable machine economy will only emerge from a shared, vendor-neutral
    ecosystem, inside which commercial and non-profit organizations will pool resources
    towards common goals. In other words, the European machine economy platform must be open
    source, and its governance must be under the stewardship of a truly European open source
    foundation.  
    In this presentation, you will learn how open source upends the old dynamics found in
    the industrial automation and automotive industries to foster truly open ecosystems. You
    will also find Eclipse Foundation initiatives, such as Oniro, Sparkplug, and Software
    Defined Vehicle (SDV), that you can leverage and join.

  room: Sizi 2
  abstract: |
    While the technical aspects of building embedded Linux systems may seem straightforward
    initially, the inherent complexity and continuous development often lead to significant
    risk down the line. The reality is that even some newly launched products contain
    outdated or vulnerable software.<br/>  
    In this presentation, Jan Lübbe will examine the reasons behind the failure of seemingly
    reasonable development and long-term maintenance approaches and propose a sustainable
    workflow for effective software management. By integrating required features into the
    upstream projects early, aligning with their support cycles, and establishing a
    predictable maintenance and testing schedule, developers can address security issues
    with controlled risk.

  abstract: |
    The AWS cloud delivers on security, scalability, and resiliency, but can it deliver on
    the I/O bandwidth that is required for engineering teams build, deliver, and maintain
    embedded Linux distributions? Early in development cycles, continuous integration is
    strongly desired to identify issues early. While distribution delivery requires
    end-to-end testing, virtualized testing can functionally verify code before expensive
    and time-consuming hardware-in-loop verification procedures. After delivery to
    manufacturing, the ability to quickly iterate and get system updates quickly to
    customers is desired to overcome security challenges and extend system functionality to
    improve its long-life viability. In this session, you will learn key touch points on how
    to do this from the AWS cloud.

    The most notable impact of using SW in the automotive domain is the decrease in
    fatalities as ADAS functions are more widely employed. On the other hand, SW complexity
    has seen an almost exponential growth reaching about 100 million lines of code.<br/>  
    Hardly any organization can tackle this challenge alone.<br/>  
    The Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Working Group ’s mission is to foster
    collaboration across industries to create an open technology platform for the software
    defined vehicle of the future. The working group community driven by its 36 member
    organization has chosen a “code first” approach to facilitate more agile and faster
    time-to-market software development.<br/>  
    After its formation about a year ago, the SDV WG has onboarded about 20 open source
    projects and is working on integrating several projects together to create “blueprints”.
    The frameworks emerging from these initial blueprints show the potential and benefits of
    utilizing different projects as components to build broader solutions to address more
    complex problems.<br/> This contribution introduces the SDV WG and Community, as well as
    its projects and capabilities.

  topic: "Sharing and reusing FOSS compliance material: OSSelot – The Open Source Curation Database"
  presenter: Caren Kresse
  affiliation: OSADL
  time: "14:00"
  room: Sizi 7
  abstract: |
    A major advantage of Free and Open Source software (FOSS) is the possibility to reuse
    existing components. In industry, such software is normally compiled for use in
    products, so information on licensing must be collected from source code individually.
    Nearly all FOSS licenses require license text and copyright notices to be delivered with
    the software. Depending on the scope of a project and the size and amount of contained
    FOSS components, extracting such information from source code represents a considerable
    effort, which partially cancels out the advantage of reusing existing components. Thus,
    it seems obvious to organize these tasks – just like the development of the software
    itself – in a community. This realization has led to the idea of a publicly available
    curation database for FOSS compliance information, so that such materials can be shared
    for reuse and unnecessary parallel work is avoided. In addition to data creation and
    review, organizational and legal aspects, such as trustworthiness, liability and
    automated use of the data, must also be considered. This contribution presents OSSelot,
    a community project that creates and manages a curation database, with a focus on
    embedded systems.

  presenter: Carsten Emde
  affiliation: OSADL
  time: "15:00"
  room: Sizi 2
  abstract: |
    The use of the Linux kernel and other Open Source software in embedded systems poses a
    completely different challenge than, for example, in standard PCs. The latter usually
    use uniform programs, and there are ready-made distributions for this. In contrast,
    embedded systems encompass a wide variety of use cases for which there is no standard
    solution. Instead, the software must be assembled from source code repositories, or
    existing distributions must be adapted. In both cases, however, features may be missing,
    which then have to be provided individually. To make this more efficient, providing
    missing features should be managed collectively, but before doing so it must be known
    which features are most needed. For this reason, an online survey was recently
    conducted, adressing the following areas:<br/>  
    • Development: Low memory footprint, hardware virtualization, containers, unsupported
    hardware, better mainline support, cloud connectivity<br/>  
    • Management: Life cycle more than 10 years, security updates, continuous integration,
    license compliance<br/>  
    Despite the low response rate, it can be concluded that participants primarily want
    better support for security updates and license compliance. This presentation will
    explain the results and show what steps have already been taken to implement them.

    Increasing demands on professionalism, standard compliance, security, safety and
    maintainability of embedded Linux systems mean that the selection of an appropriate
    build automation is a critical success factor for open source based products.<br/><br/>  
    In the first part the presentation briefly introduces the most important high level
    requirements on an industrial grade Linux which is meant to be used e.g. in automotive
    or medical technology. In the next step the requirements for the build automation and
    build infrastructure will be derived.<br/>  
    In the second part the most common embedded Linux build and build automation systems
    will be compared against these requirements.<br/>  
    The presentation focuses in particular on complexity and useability, CI/CD/CT demands,
    automated documentation, reproducibility and open source compliance. Furthermore the
    feasibility and potential efforts of platform strategies will be discussed as well as
    the practicability of embedded Linux CVE monitoring and lifecycle maintenance concepts
    which each build system.<br/><br/>  
    These fields of action are critical elements of a strategic technology planning.<br/>  
    Target group of the presentation are embedded Linux developers as well as development
    and product managers.

  topic: "Exploring RAUC: A Flexible Building Block for Embedded Linux Updates"
  presenter: Rouven Czerwinski
  affiliation: Pengutronix
  time: "16:30"
  room: Sizi 5
  abstract: |
    In this talk, we will delve into RAUC, the embedded Linux update framework, focusing on
    its unique features and advantages for managing system updates.<br/>  
    The presentation will begin with an introduction to the fundamental concepts surrounding
    A/B fallback and update signing in the context of embedded Linux updates. We will then
    explore how RAUC addresses these concerns by offering a flexible building block for
    streamlined update management.<br/>  
    The discussion will progress to cover RAUC's bundle-based update system, which allows
    for comprehensive system updates without the need for local storage, thanks to HTTP
    streaming. Additionally, we will demonstrate how adaptive updates minimize download
    sizes without necessitating version-specific patch management.

    platforms, specifying new architectures based on the demands, constraints and
    opportunities of automotive applications.<br/>  
    RISC-V is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that enables companies the
    freedom to design their best possible processors for their application. Over 10 billion
    RISC-V cores have already shipped, with this adoption spreading innovation across all
    domains and performance points.<br/>  
    The RISC-V ecosystem of member companies delivers the technologies and tools to develop
    these new platforms with flexible multi-sourcing across a range of development options
    from buying chips, to licensing processor IP, to designing your own cores. Joining as a
    member of RISC-V enables you to be part of the conversations shaping the future of the
    standard.<br/>  
    RISC-V enables design flexibility and freedom, delivering levels of customisation not
    possible with other compute architectures.Come to this talk by Peter Lewin, the Chair of
    the Automotive Special Interest Group, to find out more about RISC-V and its ecosystem
    and how it can enable the next generation of automotive computing.<br/>
