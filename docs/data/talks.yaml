  topic: Attaining nirvana on embedded devices with SUSE’s open-source solution
  presenter: Naveen Suryakumar, Martin Wolf
  affiliation: SUSE
  time: "11:30"
  room: Sizi 2
  abstract: |
    Building an IoT embedded device is easy. Wait.. What about building an exemplary
    device?<br/>  
    To develop such a device, right ingredients of tools and framework are required, which
    not only solve the functional requirements but also are best-in-class in compliance and
    security with reduced DevOp friction and Time to market.<br/>  
    This session focuses on the benefits of using open source software for developing IoT
    embedded devices and SUSE’s contribution towards it. SUSE explains how open source
    software can help achieve nirvana or a state of perfect harmony in IoT development by
    providing flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The presentation also
    highlights the importance of security and the role that open source communities can play
    in ensuring the security of IoT devices. Overall, the presentation aims to demonstrate
    the advantages of open source software for IoT development and its potential to enhance
    the performance and security of embedded devices.

  topic: The machine economy will be open source or will not be 
  presenter: Frédéric Desbiens

  abstract: |
    The machine economy is on our doorstep. Embedded technologies play a critical part in
    building it.<br/>  
    While the industrial revolution improved our lives, it was not built on sustainable
    energy sources and infrastructure. We cannot afford to build the machine economy in the
    same way. A sustainable machine economy will only emerge from a shared, vendor-neutral
    ecosystem, inside which commercial and non-profit organizations will pool resources
    towards common goals. In other words, the European machine economy platform must be open
    source, and its governance must be under the stewardship of a truly European open source
    foundation.  
    In this presentation, you will learn how open source upends the old dynamics found in
    the industrial automation and automotive industries to foster truly open ecosystems. You
    will also find Eclipse Foundation initiatives, such as Oniro, Sparkplug, and Software
    Defined Vehicle (SDV), that you can leverage and join.
