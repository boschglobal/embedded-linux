    The FOSS Disclosure Portal of Mercedes-Benz is a custom-built solution to automate and
    digitize the process for disclosure of the Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
    components, which are included in products and applications.  
    With the FOSS Disclosure Portal we aim at a more efficient, transparent and digital
    software supply chain regarding open source: With the FOSS Disclosure Portal we enable
    our internal and external software suppliers to deliver us information on used open
    source via a technical interface (API) in an ISO standardized exchange format as
    Software Bill of Material (SBOM/SPDX).  
    Based on these SBOM deliveries, the system supports the responsible project owners
    through automated compliance checks and quality checks on a central inventory. This way
    we enable checking license conformance much easier and faster, identified issues are
    directly resolved with the collaboration of the software supplier.  
    In this talk, we discuss the role and benefits of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for
    Free & Open Source Software from a license compliance perspective of an automotive OEM.
    After an introduction of basic concepts of SBOM, we sketch the FOSS SBOM consumption
    process and its relation to software composition analysis. The talk concludes with some
    of the identified FOSS SBOM challenges.

  topic: Why Rust for embedded systems security development? A security guy's perspective
  presenter: Nihal Pasham
  affiliation: Bosch TOP97
  time: "11:30"
  room: S6
  abstract: |
    The general consensus amongst systems programmers (and by extension embedded systems developers) 
    has been that you can either have fine-grained system control or performance or safety 
    (or some combination of 2 of these 3) but you can’t have all three. Rust is the first mainstream 
    (i.e. popular) programming language to provide programmers the ability to write code without this 
    compromise via its novel ownership and borrowing concept. Rust’s ownership and borrowing model 
    coupled with the fact that we do not require a garbage collector for memory management has pushed 
    Rust’s adoption into domains that were exclusively dominated by languages such as C/C++. This talk 
    will focus on what Rust has to offer to an embedded systems security software engineer - safety by 
    construction, zero-cost abstractions, no hidden states, powerful compile-time checks. These features 
    have allowed us to build demonstrators with sizeable benefits such as better performance/watt, smaller
    code-sizes and lower code complexity with a significantly higher bar on safety and security. As an 
    example, we have an open-source project called rustBoot - a prototype standalone bootloader, written 
    entirely in Rust, designed to run on anything from a microcontroller to a system on chip.

    Looking at system architectures for complex embedded systems, similarities can be observed
    across various industries. Beside a rich OS (such as Linux), often an RTOS and virtualization
    or containers are involved. However, when it comes to prototyping such systems, the
    existing guidelines are limited and reproducing demos is hard and time consuming.
    The ELISA project’s systems working group focuses on creating an exemplary system
    architecture using Linux (like from AGL, CIP or APERTIS), Xen and Zephyr in a reproducible form.
    This includes step-by-step documentation for users on different expert levels and various
    entry points to approach these systems. The results of this activity are presented and shared
    as part of the talk. Additionally, an outlook to further work is provided, which includes picking
    up new requirements such as a system SBOM. The demand for strong interaction and collaboration
    among various open source projects will also be shortly addressed in this talk. Finally, the
    talk gets rounded up by showcasing the system implementation state. The demonstrated example
    is based on embedded automotive hardware and facilitates the usage of the AGL reference stack
    along with Xen and Zephyr.

    Back in 2021 we presented our view on [Open Source Management for Linux systems and the 
    challenges we saw on automating Open Source Management](https://ocs2021.sched.com/event/pcuC/open-compliance-reference-tooling-meets-linux-marcel-kurzmann-bosch)
    stating that "Based on the circumstances, that there are different Linux distributions, 
    typically demanding license and obligation setups, architectural aspects to consider 
    and a broad variety of distribution contexts, this could be seen as the 
    "champions league" of Open Source Compliance Management Automation."   
    The circumstances didn't change, but now after two years in the course of the TOP97 
    project we had the chance to have a deeper look, widen the horizon (Apertis, Yocto, 
    Elbe, ...), create a build based prototype workflow and also enhance the scope from 
    mere Open Source Management to a holistic Software Management perspective (also 
    covering questions about SBOMs, security, export control, ...). The talk will give 
    an insight in the journey behind us, update on the current status of the progress 
    and an outlook about the services that are planned in the future.

  presenter: Philipp Ahmann 
  affiliation: Bosch TOP97
  time: "13:30"
  room: S4
  abstract: |
    Open-source software is not for free - the less you give, the more it costs. This may
    sound contradictory, but can become especially true for those ignoring the differences
    between an open source community and an commercially contracted software provider.

    As projects and product development are typically driven by schedule, resources, and
    costs, it sounds logical for a project manager to take quick-wins by selecting existing
    open-source software components, during product development phase. However, the total
    cost of software components over lifetime and the impact a bad package selection can
    have, are easily underestimated. It will become even more severe, if software gets
    locally modified and maintained without upstreaming to the original source. 

    Additionally, the talk explains why there is (typically) no way around open source from
    a project manager perspective and which additionally benefits are created beside cost,
    content and schedule improvements.

  abstract: |
    While the technical aspects of building embedded Linux systems may seem straightforward
    initially, the inherent complexity and continuous development often lead to significant
    risk down the line. The reality is that even some newly launched products contain
    outdated or vulnerable software.  
    In this presentation, Jan Lübbe will examine the reasons behind the failure of seemingly
    reasonable development and long-term maintenance approaches and propose a sustainable
    workflow for effective software management. By integrating required features into the
    upstream projects early, aligning with their support cycles, and establishing a
    predictable maintenance and testing schedule, developers can address security issues
    with controlled risk.

  abstract: |
    The AWS cloud delivers on security, scalability, and resiliency, but can it deliver on
    the I/O bandwidth that is required for engineering teams build, deliver, and maintain
    embedded Linux distributions? Early in development cycles, continuous integration is
    strongly desired to identify issues early. While distribution delivery requires
    end-to-end testing, virtualized testing can functionally verify code before expensive
    and time-consuming hardware-in-loop verification procedures. After delivery to
    manufacturing, the ability to quickly iterate and get system updates quickly to
    customers is desired to overcome security challenges and extend system functionality to
    improve its long-life viability. In this session, you will learn key touch points on how
    to do this from the AWS cloud.

    The most notable impact of using SW in the automotive domain is the decrease in
    fatalities as ADAS functions are more widely employed. On the other hand, SW complexity
    has seen an almost exponential growth reaching about 100 million lines of code.  
    Hardly any organization can tackle this challenge alone.  
    The Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Working Group ’s mission is to foster
    collaboration across industries to create an open technology platform for the software
    defined vehicle of the future. The working group community driven by its 36 member
    organization has chosen a “code first” approach to facilitate more agile and faster
    time-to-market software development.  
    After its formation about a year ago, the SDV WG has onboarded about 20 open source
    projects and is working on integrating several projects together to create “blueprints”.
    The frameworks emerging from these initial blueprints show the potential and benefits of
    utilizing different projects as components to build broader solutions to address more
    complex problems.

  presenter: Christian Henkel
  affiliation: Bosch (ROS)
  time: "14:30"
  room: S6
  abstract: |
    The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a widely adopted platform for building robotics
    applications due to its modular and distributed architecture.  
    In this talk, we will introduce ROS and explore its core components and
    functionalities.  
    We will also highlight the role of the ROS community in supporting and enhancing the
    platform, and discuss the benefits of working within a collaborative and open source
    community.  
    The components of ROS include a middleware that allows for the communication between the
    robots components.  
    We will also highlight the development tools and processes for the building and
    distribution of ROS software and outline some of the most important packages that are
    available.  
    Many business units of Bosch contribute to ROS today.  
    We will describe how and why Bosch makes use of this powerful open source platform and
    what can be learned from this.

bosch_top97_5:
  topic: Verified Boot (Security)
  presenter: Ulrich Matejek
  affiliation: Bosch TOP97
  time: "15:00"
  room: S4
  abstract: |
    A secure boot process establishes a chain of trust from (ideally) the hardware to the 
    boot loader to the kernel and the applications of an embedded Linux system. Too often, 
    the last link in this chain which secures the applications and their configuration data 
    is weakened by relying on a read-only file system which does not protect against e.g., 
    data manipulation while the system is powered off.  
    In this talk, we present a blueprint for a secure boot process and a data integrity 
    solution that provide assurance that applications and (static) configuration data has 
    not been tampered with.  
    The design choices allowed by the building blocks of the implementation - OverlayFS, 
    dm-verity, and rustBoot - as well as the (planned) integration with RAUC for system 
    updates are examined and compared.

  topic: Eclipse SDV with Kuksa, Velocitas and Leda
  presenter: Sven Erik Jeroschewski
  affiliation: Bosch SDV
  time: "15:00"
  room: S5
  abstract: |
    In the Eclipse SDV working group, ETAS supports the development of multiple OSS projects 
    to significantly increase the development speed of new vehicle functionalities. 
    During this talk, we will showcase these Eclipse SDV technologies by presenting how we used 
    them to develop a fleet management system on top of Linux, implementing the rFMS standard.
    Among other efforts, a central architectural component is to establish an abstraction layer for 
    exchanging data between deeply embedded vehicle systems and more high-level applications in a 
    uniform way. 
    This abstraction benefits many use cases by making it easier to build and port applications. 
    The data broker from Eclipse Kuksa.val acts as an abstraction layer to leverage the advantages 
    of a standardized description of vehicle signals, like the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification 
    (VSS) that introduces a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals. In addition, the Eclipse Velocitas 
    project supports application developers during their work by providing an SDK to interact with the 
    Kuksa.Val data broker, a pre-configured development environment within a container, and templates 
    for executing CI/CD processes. 
    The Eclipse Leda project supports device integrators by providing a Linux distribution combining 
    the Kuksa.Val data broker, data providers for the data broker, and a runtime to execute applications
    developed with Eclipse Velocitas.

  topic: "Sharing and reusing FOSS compliance material: OSSelot – The Open Source Curation Database"
  presenter: Caren Kresse
  affiliation: OSADL
  time: "15:00"
  room: S6
  abstract: |
    A major advantage of Free and Open Source software (FOSS) is the possibility to reuse
    existing components. In industry, such software is normally compiled for use in
    products, so information on licensing must be collected from source code individually.
    Nearly all FOSS licenses require license text and copyright notices to be delivered with
    the software. Depending on the scope of a project and the size and amount of contained
    FOSS components, extracting such information from source code represents a considerable
    effort, which partially cancels out the advantage of reusing existing components. Thus,
    it seems obvious to organize these tasks – just like the development of the software
    itself – in a community. This realization has led to the idea of a publicly available
    curation database for FOSS compliance information, so that such materials can be shared
    for reuse and unnecessary parallel work is avoided. In addition to data creation and
    review, organizational and legal aspects, such as trustworthiness, liability and
    automated use of the data, must also be considered. This contribution presents OSSelot,
    a community project that creates and manages a curation database, with a focus on
    embedded systems.

  topic: "Industry-grade Linux: Outcome of a recent survey and follow-up"
  presenter: Carsten Emde
  affiliation: OSADL
  time: "15:30"
  room: S6
  abstract: |
    The use of the Linux kernel and other Open Source software in embedded systems poses a
    completely different challenge than, for example, in standard PCs. The latter usually
    use uniform programs, and there are ready-made distributions for this. In contrast,
    embedded systems encompass a wide variety of use cases for which there is no standard
    solution. Instead, the software must be assembled from source code repositories, or
    existing distributions must be adapted. In both cases, however, features may be missing,
    which then have to be provided individually. To make this more efficient, providing
    missing features should be managed collectively, but before doing so it must be known
    which features are most needed. For this reason, an online survey was recently
    conducted, adressing the following areas:

    - Development: Low memory footprint, hardware virtualization, containers, unsupported
      hardware, better mainline support, cloud connectivity  
    - Management: Life cycle more than 10 years, security updates, continuous integration,
      license compliance

    Despite the low response rate, it can be concluded that participants primarily want
    better support for security updates and license compliance. This presentation will
    explain the results and show what steps have already been taken to implement them.

  abstract: |
    The machine economy is on our doorstep. Embedded technologies play a critical part in
    building it.  
    While the industrial revolution improved our lives, it was not built on sustainable
    energy sources and infrastructure. We cannot afford to build the machine economy in the
    same way. A sustainable machine economy will only emerge from a shared, vendor-neutral
    ecosystem, inside which commercial and non-profit organizations will pool resources
    towards common goals. In other words, the European machine economy platform must be open
    source, and its governance must be under the stewardship of a truly European open source
    foundation.  
    In this presentation, you will learn how open source upends the old dynamics found in
    the industrial automation and automotive industries to foster truly open ecosystems. You
    will also find Eclipse Foundation initiatives, such as Oniro, Sparkplug, and Software
    Defined Vehicle (SDV), that you can leverage and join.

  topic: Bosch MEMS Mobility Sensors – Linux drivers open new market segments in infotainment and telematics
  presenter: Kai Dolde
  affiliation: Bosch AE
  time: "16:00"
  room: S6
  abstract: |
    Motivation  
    The product family of Bosch MEMS Mobility Sensors addresses sensing requirements of automotive 
    use-cases in non-safety related domains such as telematics and infotainment.
    For sensor applications in consumer markets, supporting host-software (Linux driver, Android HAL)
    is standardized and established. In contrast, the automotive industry shifts gradually to 
    software-defined eco-systems being slowly but continuously influenced by expectations and 
    standards initially settled in consumer electronics.
    Linux drivers at Automotive Electronics enable smooth system integration for reference designers,
    distributors, and direct customers and enable new market shares, keeping balance to comply 
    with automotive regulations and expectations. Additional driver upstreaming will increase
    the visibility of Bosch in the Linux community and attract more customers to use our sensors
    to keep Bosch in the leading position in the MEMS market.
    
    Methods  
    We develop Linux drivers and Android HAL, using RasPi and an automated CI Pipeline, 
    for our internal and external customers. 
    The drivers are published on www.github.com/boschmemssolutions.
    
    Results  
    Development of Linux Drivers for MEMS Sensors is an essential element of the Mobility Sensor business, enabling new market shares and customer awards.
